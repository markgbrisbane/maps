[**WA Labor Factions Map**](https://walaborfactions.netlify.app)
The WA labor factions map is created from the data reported in [this article](https://www.watoday.com.au/politics/western-australia/what-are-wa-labor-s-factions-and-who-sits-where-20210315-p57awv.html) as well as the advice of several user submissions. Our aim is to create the most accurate map possible - but due to the nature of this crowdsourced data, it may contain errors or inaccuracies. Please bare this in mind when using it, check other sources to confirm details. If you find an inaccuracy you'd like to help us fix, submit a pull request, or comment the updated information [on this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15o0X79WuNDE9Un7r1ttPE7VeZTimmZMZ8mkKAtdBT_o/edit?usp=sharing).
